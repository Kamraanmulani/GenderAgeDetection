his project is a real-time age and gender detection application using OpenCV and deep learning models. It captures video from a webcam, detects faces in the video stream, and predicts the age and gender of each detected face.

## Features

- Real-time face detection.
- Age prediction for detected faces.
- Gender classification for detected faces.
- Visualization of predictions on the video feed.

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- OpenCV
- Pre-trained models for face detection, age estimation, and gender classification
